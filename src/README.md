# Python GUI project

### Uses tkinter and PIL (pillow) for gui and image loading respectively
This Project was to show my knowledge of GUIs using Tkinter. I also utilized PIL (pillow) for image loading for each button; the buttons each had an image of a die.
I also utilized the os.system call to open the native text editor of the system running to display the results of the stored rolls for the current session.
